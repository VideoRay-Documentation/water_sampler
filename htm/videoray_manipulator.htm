<h3>VideoRay Manipulator</h3>

<p>The VideoRay Manipulator allows the Pro 4 to retrieve items.  The manipulator will support up to 34 kilograms (75 pounds).  The jaws open as wide as 50 mm (2 inches) and can be used with a smooth face or pointed screws for a better grip.  The manipulator jaws can be rotated while the ROV is on the surface to open and close horizontally, vertically or at any angle in between.</p>
