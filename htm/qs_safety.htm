<h1>Safety First</h1>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_danger.png"> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Operating electrical devices in and near the water can be dangerous.  There is always a risk of drowning or electrocution in such an environment.  Reduce these risks by using common sense and observing safety regulations and recommended safe practices including the following:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Never handle power cords while in contact with water or allow power cord connectors or the control panel to enter the water.  The only components that can safely be placed in water are the submersible, any onboard accessories and tether, and only after making sure the connections are secure.<p></p></li>

  <li>Always test the GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter)<!--4-->, and LIM (Line Insulation Monitor)<!--/4--> before beginning operations.  Follow the procedures described later in these Quick Start Instructions.<p></p></li>

  <li>Have proper safety equipment, such as PFDs (Personal Flotation Devices), on hand and make sure you know how to use them before you need them.<p></p></li>

  <li>Keep fingers, hair, loose clothing and other objects away from VideoRay's propellers.<p></p></li>

  <li>Be aware of and follow any legal ordinances or regulations in your area regarding operation of vessels and underwater equipment in the water.<p></p></li>

  <li>Monitor weather and sea conditions and heed any warnings or alerts.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_tip.gif"> Before setting up for or commencing any dive, it is a good practice to make sure there are no hazards to people or the equipment on land or in the water. If there are other people in the water nearby, you should advise them that you are going to be operating the ROV.  As the owner/operator, it is your responsibility to ensure the safety of those around you as well as that of the equipment and nearby property.</p>
