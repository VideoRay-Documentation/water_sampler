<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The Water Sampler tool is designed to collect a water sample at depth.  This section provides an overview and technical specifications.</p>

<h2>Design Brief</h2>

<p>The Water Sampler tool is designed to be mounted on a VideoRay Pro 4 ROV and can be used to collect a water sample at depth.  It can also be used to expel a volume of liquid at depth, which can be used for activities such as crack detection or flow analysis.  The volume of the sample can range from 0 ml to 100 ml.</p>

<h2>Technical Specifications</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool can be mounted on the Pro 4 ROV skid.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool weight in air and weight in water do not affect the ability to handle the ROV or ballast the ROV correctly under normal operating conditions without the need for additional flotation.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool can be operated using the power available at the ROV accessory port.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool is depth rated to 300 m (1,000 ft).</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool can be used to collect a liquid sample size of 0 ml to 100 ml while underwater.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool can be used to expel a liquid sample size of 0 ml to 100 ml in air or while underwater.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool allows for the use of a "Stop block" that limits the sample size to be no larger than a specific volume in the range of 0 ml to 100 ml.  A stop block for a 25 ml sample is included with the Water Sampler tool.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool will retain the sample while in transit.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool reservoir container is translucent to allow visual inspection of the sample.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool volume markings are visible from the ROV camera when the tool is mounted to the skid in a normal configuration.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool can be reused and easily mounted or removed from the ROV.</li>
  <li>The Water Sampler tool is activated by the hand controller with separate buttons for open (collect) or close (expel).</li>
  <li>Materials used in the Water Sampler tool are compatible for us in Sellafield ponds.</li>
  <li>All external aluminum components of the Water Sampler tool have Cerakote applied.</li>
